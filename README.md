### From the General course information 
  - Grade 1:  The Booking system project → Phase 1 accepted

### Step 1:
  - Read the initial situation attached to the assignment

### Step 2:
  - Create a penetration testing environment
  - The recommended environment is the following combo:
      - https://www.virtualbox.org/
      - https://www.kali.org/
      - https://www.docker.com/
      - https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/installing-docker-on-kali/
      - https://www.zaproxy.org/
      - https://portswigger.net/burp (comes with Kali)

### Step 3:
  - According to the initial situation, you should enable the application made by the manufacturer
  - You can find the application here: https://github.com/vheikkiniemi/animated-waddle/tree/main/Booking%20system/Phase%201
  - In Kali, you should find the application (as shown in the screenshot) at http://localhost:8000/register

### Step 4:
  - Perform as comprehensive penetration and functionality testing as possible on the application's registration page.
      - **Note! The application has many flaws.**
  - Make a test report in a separate folder in git (make a page using markdown syntax)
      - Folder name: Booking system - Phase 1
  - Add to folder Checkmarx ZAP report
      - Report must be in MD format.
  - **Add a link to your git repo in your submission**
      - **Example of submission:**  
        **Link to the repo:** https://github.com/vheikkiniemi/animated-waddle/tree/main/Booking%20system/Phase%201

### Step 5:
  - Go to the discussion forum: **Reporting findings to the development team**
  - Start new thread and share one of your findings (in english)
      - Tell what you found
      - What method you used
      - Where or what do you think the problem is
      - How it should be fixed
  - If you have anything to comment on the thread that has been started, comment.
  - **Everyone must make two contributions on the discussion forum.**
      - The contribution can be either **starting a new thread** or
      - **commenting** on an existing thread.

### Step 6:
  - **Update your logbook**
